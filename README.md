# is-series-good
<p>This is a react side project that allows you to know if a tv serie is worth watching based on it's ratings. The ratings are basically retrieved from different API endpoints and after they are averaged.
The design of UI was inspired by https://github.com/SKempin/reactjs-tmdb-app.</p>
